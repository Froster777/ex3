The United States places significant regulatory stress on crypto exchanges with [Exchanger24](https://exchanger24.org), which can make it difficult for US-based crypto traders to identify which trading platforms are suitable for their needs. Cryptocurrency exchanges that operate in the United States are subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which enforces various anti-money laundering programs and requirements, FinCEN regulation, as well as other rules and regulations across various government agencies.

Cryptocurrency exchanges that operate in New York State, for example, are regarded as money transmission services — forcing exchanges that operate in the region to obtain specific licensing. Many crypto exchanges that allow users to transact in crypto assets that are defined as securities under US federal securities laws must also ensure they are compliant with various SEC requirements.

Coinbase is the most popular and successful cryptocurrency exchange based in the United States, and offers an extremely user-friendly UI and trading experience. Founded in 2014 and based in San Francisco, Coinbase is a great choice for both new traders and professional investors.

Coinbase users can swap between a simple cryptocurrency brokerage interface with simplified trading controls, or a feature-rich Coinbase Pro interface ideal for more complex trading requirements. The Coinbase platform can be accessed via a web interface or a dedicated smartphone app, and offers robust security features.

Importantly, Coinbase has never suffered from a major cryptocurrency hack and has a strong security record. In addition to protecting user funds, Coinbase actively prevents users from sending cryptocurrency to known scam addresses, providing newer traders with an extra layer of protection. Funds held on Coinbase are FDIC insured, which means fiat currency deposited on the Coinbase platform by United States residents is insured up to a maximum of $250,000.

ID requirements

US residents will need to provide a valid government issued ID when verifying an account with Coinbase in addition to a selfie image.

Trade limits

Coinbase allows US residents to trade an unlimited amount of cryptocurrency on a daily basis, but limits withdrawals to $25,000 per day in most cases.‍

Trading fees

‍Coinbase doesn’t offer the most competitive fees in the market today, with taker fees between 0.05% and 0.25% and maker fees from 0% up to 0.15%. The relatively standard fees are offset by the high level of security and customer service, however.

Fiat currency support

Coinbase supports deposits in USD and a variety of other fiat currencies.

Deposit & withdrawal methods

Deposits and withdrawals can be made via ACH. Credit or debit card purchases incur an additional 3.99% fee, while wire transfer withdrawals incur a $10 fee.

Supported cryptocurrencies

Coinbase supports a diverse range of 39+ cryptocurrencies including BTC, ETH, DASH, EOS, LINK, XRP, and many more. Tether, however, is not supported by Coinbase — US Coinbase users are provided with USDC as a USD-pegged stablecoin instead.
